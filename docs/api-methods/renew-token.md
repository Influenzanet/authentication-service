**Renew token**
----
  Validate and if still valid renew a token generated by the service earlier. Tokens expire after 72 hours, and after expiration the user has to log in again. Before expiration, the client has the possibility to request a new token without re-sending the credentials at this endpoint.
  Clients sending renewal request too eagerly (with intervals shorter than 30 minutes), will not receive a new token.

* **URL**

  /v1/token/renew

* **Method:**

  `GET`

* **Header Params** <br />
  **Required:**
  `Authorization: Bearer <token string>`

* **URL Params** <br />
  **Optional:** (instead of header params) <br />
  `token=[string]`

* **Data Params**
  None

* **Success Response:**

  * **Code:** 200 <br />
    **Content:** `{ "token": "<token string>" }`

* **Error Response:**

  * **Code:** 400 Bad request <br />
    **Content:** `{ "error" : "<error message>" }` <br />
    **Typical reason:** Missing current token from request's header or as url param.

  * **Code:** 401 Unauthorized <br />
    **Content:** `{ "error" : "<error message>",  "reason": <reason message> }` <br />
    **Typical reason:** Current token is not valid (e.g. wrong or expired).

  * **Code:** 418 I'm a tea pot <br />
    **Content:** `{ "error" : "can't renew token so often" }` <br />
    **Typical reason:** Client sends token renewal request too often.

  * **Code:** 500 Internal server error <br />
    **Content:** `{ "error" : "<error message>" }` <br />
    **Typical reason:** Something went wrong during the token generation, e.g., because signing key is not available.

* **Sample Call:**

  ```go
    token = "<your-received-token>"
    client := &http.Client{}
    req, _ := http.NewRequest("GET", auth-service-addr + "/v1/token/renew", nil)
    req.Header.Add("Authorization", "Bearer "+ token)
    resp, err := client.Do(req)
    defer resp.Body.Close()
  ```
* **Notes:**
  Token will keep currently used role (e.g. admin).
