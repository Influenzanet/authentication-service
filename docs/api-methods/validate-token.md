**Validate token**
----
  Validate and decrypt a token generated by the service earlier. Used typically for athenticating incoming requests.

* **URL**

  /v1/token/validate

* **Method:**

  `GET`

* **Header Params**
  **Required:**
  `Authorization: Bearer <token string>`

* **URL Params**
  **Optional:** (instead of header params)
  `token=[string]`

* **Success Response:**

  * **Code:** 200
    **Content:** `{ "token": "<token string>" }`

* **Error Response:**

  * **Code:** 400 Bad request
    **Content:** `{ "error" : "no Authorization token found" }`
    **Typical reason:** Token is not sent with the request, neither in the header nor as an url param.

  OR

  * **Code:** 401 Unauthorized
    **Content:** `{ "error" : "token not valid" }`
    **Typical reason:** Token expired or wrong (e.g. signed with the wrong key).

  OR

  * **Code:** 500 Internal server error
    **Content:** `{ "error" : "<error message>" }`
    **Typical reason:** Something went wrong during the token decrypting process, e.g., because verification key is not available.


* **Sample Call:**
  TODO: add sample call for go

  ```javascript
    $.ajax({
      url: "/users/1",
      dataType: "json",
      type : "GET",
      success : function(r) {
        console.log(r);
      }
    });
  ```
* **Notes:**
  As long as the old verification key is present, the method accepts tokens signed with that key as well.
